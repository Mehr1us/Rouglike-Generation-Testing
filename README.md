# Rouglike-Generation-Testing
my repos for Testing Generation, clearly not efficient code, just my attempt at rougelike-2d-generation

## [DWCA:](https://github.com/Mehr1us/Rouglike-Generation-Testing/blob/main/DWCA.cpp)  
Useful for making caves  
Jesus Christ that took too long to debug.

Too lazy to make pathfinifing to connect up all created rooms

## [Grid-Based:](https://github.com/Mehr1us/Rouglike-Generation-Testing/blob/main/Grid.cpp)  
http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Grid_Based_Dungeon_Generator  
Possible Future Addition: Hallways and doors to connect up the rooms  
Useful for basic Dungeons  
["Grid based dungeon generation.png"](https://github.com/Mehr1us/Rouglike-Generation-Testing/blob/main/Grid%20based%20dungeon%20generation.png) is 6 example outputs for my Grid based program.  

## [Random Box Splitting](https://github.com/Mehr1us/Rouglike-Generation-Testing/blob/main/BoxSplit.cpp)  
I *wanted* to make the grid-based generation more random by having randomly shaped 'grid' portions instead of static squares  
after hours of headache caused probably by my own bad coding I gave up instead of rewriting it.  
If you want to explore my trash go on, but i'm not planning on adding comments.
